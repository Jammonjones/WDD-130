    <p>Background: I Grew up in Utah, in a house of 7. I lived in Kearns for 11 years, and then moved to
     Sandy when I was 11. I have 3 brothers, and 1 sister. I have always been someone who loves adrenaline, and
    making things. I love all the adventures that the mountains in Utah
    make possible. </p>
    <p>While a teenage I discovered some of my most favorite hobbies which were mountain biking
    and snowboarding. I did the bare minimum to get by with A's in school and then
    would go spend all the time I could with my friends
    in the mountains doing these hobbies.
    </p>
    <p>I then served a mission in Mozambique and upon returning I met my wife Shannon down at Snow College. After dating for 11 months we were married and now 
        been married for over a year.
