            <h1>For becoming aware:</h1>
            <p>Start taking note of the negative instructions that you give yourself each day that arenâ€™t helping you achieve your goals.</p>
            <h1>For changing your instructions:</h1>
            <p>Take the list of things that you have told yourself that have not been helping you achieve your goals and create a new list of things to tell yourself that are in line with attaining your goals. Again make sure to only write down things that are believable and realistic or else your mind will not accept them as valid instructions. </p>
            <h1>For making your words work for you: </h1>
            <p>In order for you to make any significant changes in your life you are going to need to implement a system for change. I suggest setting aside 10 minutes every day for a mindfulness meditation and another 10 minutes to read through the new list of instructions that you have created for yourself so that your new instructions really get ingrained in your brain.</p>
