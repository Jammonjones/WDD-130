            <p>It is definitely not easy using your words to create the world that you would like, but there are a few simple guidelines to help you to become the person that uses your words wisely to create the results that you want instead of letting your words destroy your hopes and dreams by breaking down the very thing that you are trying to build. </p>
            <h1>Step 1 - Become Aware</h1>
            <p>Start paying attention to what you tell yourself each day. This can be hard so the best way to start is by paying attention to your thoughts when you are feeling down in the day and start linking your thoughts with your performance and how you are feeling. Tip: Start taking 10 minutes everyday and doing mindfulness meditation. This is where you stop doing things and pay attention to what is going on all around you and also inside yourself. This way you can start paying attention to your thoughts and gain more control of what is usually going on unconsciously inside yourself. </p>
            <h1>Step 2 - Alter The Instructions that donâ€™t serve you</h1>
            <p>Think of something realistic that you could believe yourself about how you are going to perform. It is essentially that you can believe it yourself or else your brain will spit it out as bad instructions and not take them seriously.             </p>
            <h1>Step 3 - Give Yourself New Instructions</h1>
            <p>Tell yourself your new positive instructions that help you to achieve your goals a few times.            </p>
