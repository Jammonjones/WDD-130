            <h1>We are robots that program ourselves</h1>
            <p>Did you know that you are a robot that controls itself? No i’m being serious we humans are machines capable of doing all sorts of great, but also horrible things. The only difference between us and a robot is that we choose what instructions to give ourselves and then just like a robot we follow them. You might not believe me, but if you have ever heard of the phrase “Self fulfilling prophecy” this is precisely what I am speaking about. How often do you tell yourself that you are going to score horribly on a test and perform well? How often do we say that we are going to be nice to someone and then be mean? Probably rarely and that is becasue we believe what we tell ourselves and if we tell ourselves that we are going to fail and believe it then do you really think that we are going to put forth the right amount of effort believing that we are just going to fail? No and who would??? Why waste your time??? We believe the words we tell ourselves and they in turn become a self fulfilling prophecy. It’s not magic, it’s reality. We follow the instructions that we give ourselves. Once you realize that I am right, you might then want to use your words to better accomplish your goals in life. Where should you start? Why this website? We all speak to ourselves whether we do it outloud or in our head. If you stop and pay attention to the voice that is in your head you will realize that you speak to yourself more than you think. Sadly when we start to pay attention to our thoughts we realize that we often are really negative towards ourselves and we are feeding ourselves instructions for failure rather than success. The purpose of this website is to provide people with the right information that they need to stop self sabotage and to begin creating the life they want starting with the words they use inside their heads. Who should be interested? In all reality this website is for anyone who wants things to improve in their life and have yet to train their inner leader.</p>
